movie_scraper
=============

My own take on a scraper for the movie body count website (http://www.moviebodycounts.com/), prompted by a comparison of R and python solutions originally posted at http://www.theswarmlab.com/r-vs-python-round-2/.

While the python solution presented there works well enough, I wanted to put together an alternate solution I thought was:
- I think is more more 'pythonic' (list comprehensions, etc)
- Showed off some of the key python libraries you'd want to use for this sort of thing (requests, beautifulsoup, pandas).

My version ends up being roughly the same length as the original (once you account for comments/docstrings), but does at least show some of the neat features of beautifulsoup for exploring the document tree.
